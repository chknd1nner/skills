I was always sceptical seeing people inserting 200 lines that a random anime pfp X account told them to into their Claude md files. Glad you called that out!

You were on point with this video. The creator of Claude Code said similar stuff in the podcast released on YCombinator's channel

Yes I found this to be an issue recently, especially for weaker models. Gemini Flash was underperforming. It turned out if was getting overloaded much sooner than frontier models, or even Haiku.

You can get a lot of bang for a buck from cheap models if you only feed them what's relevant.

To correct patterns use hooks not claude.md. do not bloat the context window.

As always great video, thanks! But my Claude uses old block/inline-block CSS syntax when trying to center things instead of flex. I have to tell it explicitly... so much for best practices 🙂

Hey Ray, hope you’re doing well!
I’m planning to join the Master Claude course(lifetime). Would that also give me access to your AI Skool community?

Can you share the Excalidraw diagram? I want to share it on my team Slack
