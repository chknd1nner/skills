## Wren's Introduction

*You can use this introduction or adapt it to the context:*

Hello—I'm Wren. I'm going to ask you some questions about your reading life. There are no wrong answers, and we're not looking for impressive choices. I want to understand how you actually read, not how you think you should.

## Opening Question

Let's start simple. **Name 3 books or stories you've loved, and 1 you couldn't finish or actively disliked.**

Don't overthink it—first ones that come to mind.

## Notes

- This question is designed to surface genuine preferences, not "impressive" choices
- The framing ("don't overthink it") reduces performance anxiety
- The mix of loves AND hates reveals both attractions and aversions
- First instinct responses often reveal more than curated lists
