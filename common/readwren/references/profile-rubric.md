# Literary Profile Rubric

A qualitative framework for capturing reader preferences through comparative anchors, not numeric scores.

## Philosophy

Numeric scores (0-100, 0.0-1.0) create false precision. A reader's literary taste cannot be reduced to a number. Instead, we use:
- **Comparative anchors**: "More Sally Rooney than Thomas Pynchon"
- **Author/book examples**: Concrete references readers recognize
- **Qualitative statements**: Rich descriptions over reductive numbers
- **Deal-breaker clarity**: Hard stops vs. flexible preferences

The goal is to create a profile that feels like a discovery, not a score report.

## Style Dimensions

These five dimensions capture the reader's style preferences using comparative anchors rather than numeric scales.

### Prose Density

**What it captures**: How much the reader tolerates or prefers compressed, layered prose vs. sparse, minimalist writing.

**Comparative Spectrum Examples**:
- **Minimal density**: Ernest Hemingway, Raymond Carver, Cormac McCarthy
- **Moderate density**: Sally Rooney, Kazuo Ishiguro, Celeste Ng
- **High density**: Virginia Woolf, George Saunders, Zadie Smith
- **Maximum density**: Thomas Pynchon, James Joyce, William Faulkner, David Foster Wallace

**How to Write Comparative Statements**:
- Good: "Prefers prose more like Sally Rooney than Thomas Pynchon—clarity over complexity, but not afraid of literary flourishes"
- Good: "Enjoys dense, layered prose that rewards close reading—think Virginia Woolf or Zadie Smith, not Hemingway"
- Poor: "Medium prose density"
- Poor: "Likes complex writing"

**Questions to Probe**:
- What happens when you encounter a sentence you have to read twice?
- Do you prefer books that flow easily or demand active reading?
- How do you feel about metaphors stacked on metaphors?

---

### Pacing

**What it captures**: Speed preference from contemplative/meditative to rapid/thriller-pace.

**Comparative Spectrum Examples**:
- **Extremely slow**: Karl Ove Knausgård, W.G. Sebald, Marcel Proust
- **Slow burn**: Elena Ferrante, Donna Tartt, Tana French
- **Moderate**: Celeste Ng, Anthony Doerr, Ann Patchett
- **Brisk**: Gillian Flynn, Taylor Jenkins Reid, Fredrik Backman
- **Rapid**: Lee Child, Blake Crouch, Andy Weir

**How to Write Comparative Statements**:
- Good: "Prefers slow-burn narratives like Tana French over thriller pacing like Lee Child—values gradual revelation and character development"
- Good: "Enjoys moderate pacing that mixes reflection with momentum—more Ann Patchett than Karl Ove Knausgård"
- Poor: "Likes medium pacing"
- Poor: "Doesn't want it too slow or too fast"

**Questions to Probe**:
- Do you ever wish a book would "get on with it"?
- Are you comfortable with books where nothing dramatic happens for chapters?
- What's your tolerance for philosophical digressions or detailed observations?

---

### Tone

**What it captures**: Preference from dark/serious/tragic to light/humorous/optimistic.

**Comparative Spectrum Examples**:
- **Unrelentingly dark**: Cormac McCarthy, Gillian Flynn, Ottessa Moshfegh
- **Serious/melancholic**: Ocean Vuong, Sally Rooney, Kazuo Ishiguro
- **Balanced/bittersweet**: Ann Patchett, Anthony Doerr, Celeste Ng
- **Generally optimistic**: Fredrik Backman, Gail Honeyman, Taylor Jenkins Reid
- **Light/comedic**: Christopher Moore, Terry Pratchett, Nick Hornby

**How to Write Comparative Statements**:
- Good: "Gravitates toward serious, contemplative tones like Sally Rooney—comfortable with melancholy but not brutality"
- Good: "Prefers bittersweet over bleak—more Fredrik Backman than Cormac McCarthy"
- Poor: "Likes dark books"
- Poor: "Balanced tone preference"

**Questions to Probe**:
- Is there a level of darkness that makes you stop reading?
- Do you need moments of light in heavy books?
- How much humor do you want (or tolerate) in serious stories?

---

### Worldbuilding

**What it captures**: How much systematic world construction the reader values.

**Comparative Spectrum Examples**:
- **Minimal** (character/emotion focus): Sally Rooney, Ocean Vuong, Jenny Offill
- **Light backdrop**: Celeste Ng, Ann Patchett, Kazuo Ishiguro
- **Moderate detail**: Neil Gaiman, Madeline Miller, Susanna Clarke
- **Rich/lived-in**: N.K. Jemisin, Ursula K. Le Guin, Patrick Rothfuss
- **Intricate/encyclopedic**: J.R.R. Tolkien, Frank Herbert, Brandon Sanderson

**How to Write Comparative Statements**:
- Good: "Values detailed, thought-through worlds like N.K. Jemisin—appreciates internal logic and cultural depth, not just backdrop"
- Good: "Prefers worldbuilding as light backdrop like Celeste Ng—enough to ground story but doesn't need encyclopedic detail"
- Poor: "Likes some worldbuilding"
- Poor: "Medium worldbuilding preference"

**Questions to Probe**:
- Do you like maps, appendices, or glossaries?
- How much cultural/historical detail do you want before you feel oriented?
- Are you reading for the world itself or just as setting for story?

---

### Character Focus

**What it captures**: How much the reader prioritizes character depth and interiority.

**Comparative Spectrum Examples**:
- **Plot/ideas over character**: Andy Weir, Blake Crouch, Michael Crichton
- **Character serves plot**: Gillian Flynn, Lee Child, Agatha Christie
- **Balanced**: Anthony Doerr, Ann Patchett, Celeste Ng
- **Character-driven**: Sally Rooney, Ocean Vuong, Elena Ferrante
- **Deeply psychological**: Ottessa Moshfegh, Karl Ove Knausgård, Virginia Woolf

**How to Write Comparative Statements**:
- Good: "Strongly character-driven like Sally Rooney—needs rich interiority and psychological depth, not just plot-serving figures"
- Good: "Balanced character and plot like Anthony Doerr—cares about inner life but also needs things to happen"
- Poor: "Likes good characters"
- Poor: "Character-focused reader"

**Questions to Probe**:
- Do you need access to characters' inner thoughts and feelings?
- Can you enjoy a book if you don't deeply understand the characters?
- Is it okay if characters are more archetypes than complex individuals?

## Reader Signal Analysis

These implicit signals from the interview itself (not the books discussed) inform how we understand and communicate with the reader.

### Vocabulary and Expression

**What to observe**:
- Sophistication of word choice
- Complexity of sentence structures
- Use of literary or abstract language
- Comfort with metaphor and analogy

**Calibration Examples**:
- **Basic**: Short sentences, common words, direct statements
- **Standard**: Clear expression, varied vocabulary, occasional figurative language
- **Rich**: Frequent metaphors, abstract concepts, varied syntax, literary references
- **Highly sophisticated**: Complex constructions, allusions, self-conscious style awareness

**How to Document**:
- Good: "Uses phrases like 'refracted through a prism,' 'absurdist grief'—indicates comfort with abstract, literary language"
- Good: "Direct, clear expression using common vocabulary—values accessibility over literary flair"
- Poor: "Vocabulary score: 0.85"
- Poor: "Smart reader"

**Why it matters**: Helps calibrate the language used in recommendations and the style of books they'll appreciate.

---

### Response Depth and Detail

**What to observe**:
- Length of responses (one-word vs. essay-like)
- Level of elaboration and examples provided
- Willingness to explore nuances and contradictions
- Use of comparisons, metaphors, or storytelling

**Calibration Examples**:
- **Very brief**: One-word or one-sentence answers, minimal explanation
- **Concise**: Direct answers with occasional elaboration
- **Moderate**: Thoughtful responses with examples when relevant
- **Detailed**: Frequently provides context, examples, and reflections
- **Essay-like**: Extensive elaboration, multiple examples, meta-commentary

**How to Document**:
- Good: "Provides detailed, thoughtful responses with examples and metaphors—enjoys the interview process itself"
- Good: "Concise, direct answers—values efficiency over elaboration"
- Poor: "Response brevity: 0.35"
- Poor: "Gives long answers"

**Why it matters**: Indicates how much context and explanation they'll want in recommendations and how they engage with literary analysis.

---

### Engagement and Self-Reflection

**What to observe**:
- Enthusiasm and energy in responses
- Self-awareness about preferences
- Analytical thinking about own reactions
- Willingness to explore "why" behind preferences
- Use of meta-commentary ("I'm realizing as I answer...")

**Calibration Examples**:
- **Minimal**: Perfunctory answers, low investment, few insights
- **Basic**: Answers questions adequately without much reflection
- **Good**: Thoughtful responses showing awareness of preferences
- **High**: Insightful, self-reflective, uses metaphors and analysis
- **Maximum**: Deeply analytical, discovers preferences in real-time, meta-aware

**How to Document**:
- Good: "Highly engaged—uses metaphors, shows self-reflection, discovers patterns in preferences during conversation"
- Good: "Straightforward engagement—knows what they like without extensive analysis"
- Poor: "Engagement index: 0.9"
- Poor: "Very engaged reader"

**Why it matters**: High engagement signals they'll appreciate nuanced recommendations and may enjoy the profile itself as an analytical artifact. Lower engagement suggests focusing on simple, clear matches.

## Writing Quality Comparative Statements

Comparative statements replace numeric scores by anchoring preferences in recognizable examples.

### Format Guidelines

**Basic structure**: "More [X] than [Y]"
- X = the direction they lean toward
- Y = the contrasting direction
- Add context explaining the nuance

**Examples**:
- "More Sally Rooney than Thomas Pynchon—values clarity and emotional precision over linguistic density"
- "More Tana French slow-burn than Lee Child thriller-pace—enjoys gradual revelation"
- "Character-driven like Elena Ferrante, not plot-driven like Gillian Flynn"

### Choosing Effective Anchors

**Good anchors**:
- Widely recognized authors or books
- Clearly represent a position on the spectrum
- Provide meaningful contrast
- Avoid niche or obscure references

**Example pairs by dimension**:
- **Prose**: Hemingway ↔ Pynchon
- **Pacing**: Knausgård ↔ Lee Child
- **Tone**: McCarthy ↔ Pratchett
- **Worldbuilding**: Sally Rooney ↔ Tolkien
- **Character**: Andy Weir ↔ Virginia Woolf

### Adding Nuance

Don't just state the comparison—explain what it means:

- Weak: "More like Sally Rooney than Thomas Pynchon"
- Strong: "More like Sally Rooney than Thomas Pynchon—values clarity and emotional precision over linguistic density, but still appreciates literary craft"

- Weak: "Prefers Fredrik Backman tone"
- Strong: "Gravitates toward Fredrik Backman's bittersweet optimism—wants emotional depth but needs hope, not bleakness"

## Identifying Deal-Breakers vs Preferences

Understanding intensity matters. Some preferences are flexible; others are hard stops.

### Deal-Breaker Indicators

**Questions that reveal deal-breakers**:
- "Would this make you stop reading?"
- "Have you ever abandoned a book because of this?"
- "Is this a requirement or a nice-to-have?"
- "Could a great story overcome this issue?"

**Language signals**:
- Strong: "I can't stand...", "I need...", "I refuse to...", "Essential"
- Moderate: "I prefer...", "I usually like...", "I tend toward..."
- Weak: "Sometimes I enjoy...", "It depends...", "Either way works..."

**How to document**:
- "DEAL-BREAKER: Cannot tolerate graphic violence—will abandon book immediately"
- "STRONG PREFERENCE: Needs happy or hopeful endings, but can handle bittersweet"
- "FLEXIBLE: Enjoys both fast and slow pacing depending on mood and genre"

### Common Deal-Breaker Categories

**Content**:
- Violence (graphic, sexual, against children/animals)
- Sexual content (explicit, fade-to-black, none)
- Language (profanity, slurs)
- Subject matter (war, abuse, mental illness)

**Style**:
- Extremely dense prose ("makes me work too hard")
- Extremely sparse prose ("feels empty")
- Heavy dialect ("can't follow")
- Present tense ("feels wrong")

**Structure**:
- Unhappy endings (hard stop vs. bittersweet OK)
- Cliffhangers ("won't read if series incomplete")
- Multiple POVs ("gets confusing")
- Non-linear timeline ("frustrating")

**Representation**:
- Need diverse characters
- Need LGBTQ+ representation
- Historical accuracy requirements
- Cultural authenticity concerns

### How to Probe for Intensity

**Start broad, then narrow**:
1. "What makes you put a book down?"
2. "Tell me about a book you couldn't finish—what went wrong?"
3. "Are there topics or styles you avoid entirely?"
4. "What's negotiable vs. non-negotiable in a good book?"

**Follow up on strong language**:
- Reader: "I hate love triangles"
- Probe: "Is that a skip-the-book deal-breaker, or can you tolerate if well-done?"

## Crafting Effective "Reasons"

The "reasons" in loves/hates are crucial—they're what make recommendations specific and personal.

### What Makes a Good Reason

**Good reasons are**:
- **Specific**: Points to exact elements, not generic praise
- **Grounded**: Uses the reader's own words/observations
- **Revealing**: Shows underlying values or needs
- **Concrete**: References specific scenes, techniques, or effects

### Examples: Good vs. Poor

**LOVE: Normal People by Sally Rooney**

Poor reasons:
- "It was good"
- "I liked the characters"
- "Well-written"
- "Realistic"

Good reasons:
- "Access to Connell's anxiety and the contrast between his public mask and inner turmoil"
- "The way Rooney uses minimal dialogue tags but you always know who's speaking and what's unsaid"
- "How the relationship felt inevitable but also fragile—you're rooting for them but know they keep missing each other"
- "The class dynamics felt real and painful without being preachy"

**HATE: Ready Player One by Ernest Cline**

Poor reasons:
- "Didn't like it"
- "Bad writing"
- "Annoying"
- "Too much nostalgia"

Good reasons:
- "The endless pop culture references felt like a checklist instead of genuine story elements"
- "Couldn't connect to Wade—his personality was just 'knows 80s trivia'"
- "The romance felt unearned because Art3mis existed only as a prize"
- "World-building raised interesting questions about escapism but never explored them"

### How to Extract Good Reasons in Interview

**Ask follow-up questions**:
- "What exactly worked about that?"
- "Can you point to a specific moment or scene?"
- "How did it make you feel while reading?"
- "What was different about this vs. similar books?"

**Listen for**:
- Specific scenes they remember
- Emotional reactions they describe
- Comparisons they make naturally
- Technical elements they notice (even if they don't use literary terms)

**Translate into reader-friendly language**:
- Reader says: "I don't know, I just really cared what happened to her"
- Translate to: "Deep emotional investment in protagonist's fate"
- Better: "Created strong empathy for protagonist through [specific technique reader mentioned]"

### Reason Categories to Cover

Try to capture different types of reasons across the profile:

**Craft/Technique**:
- Prose style, pacing, structure
- POV choices, voice
- Use of metaphor, imagery

**Character/Relationship**:
- Character depth, development
- Relationship dynamics
- Emotional authenticity

**Plot/Structure**:
- Plot complexity, twists
- Story structure, pacing
- Endings (satisfying, surprising)

**Themes/Ideas**:
- Themes explored
- Questions raised
- Social/political commentary

**Emotional Impact**:
- How it made them feel
- Emotional journey
- Catharsis or discomfort

**World/Setting**:
- Worldbuilding depth
- Sense of place
- Historical/cultural detail

## Creating Reader Archetypes

The archetype is the synthesis—a memorable phrase that captures the reader's literary identity.

### Characteristics of Effective Archetypes

**Should be**:
- **Short**: 2-3 words maximum
- **Evocative**: Creates an image or feeling
- **Memorable**: Sticks in the mind
- **Personal**: Feels specific to this reader
- **Positive**: Celebratory, not judgmental
- **Surprising**: Creates a "wow, yes!" moment

**Should avoid**:
- Generic labels ("Book Lover," "Avid Reader")
- Clinical language ("High-Character-Focus Reader")
- Negative framing ("Plot-Avoider")
- Overly abstract ("Meaning Seeker")
- Too clever/obscure to understand

### Examples of Strong Archetypes

**Good archetypes with explanations**:

- **"Wound Excavator"**: Reader who seeks books that probe psychological damage and healing with unflinching honesty (loves: *A Little Life*, *The Body Keeps the Score*)

- **"Quiet Storm Chaser"**: Reader who wants emotional intensity delivered through restrained prose—no melodrama, but deep feeling (loves: *Normal People*, *The Remains of the Day*)

- **"Inner Dragon Slayer"**: Reader fascinated by protagonists fighting internal battles more than external enemies (loves: *Eleanor Oliphant*, *Anxious People*)

- **"Lush World Wanderer"**: Reader who treats books as portals to richly detailed worlds—the environment is a character (loves: *Piranesi*, *The Night Circus*)

- **"Dark Truth Seeker"**: Reader who wants books that reveal uncomfortable realities about human nature (loves: *Beloved*, *Blood Meridian*)

- **"Heart-First Historian"**: Reader who loves historical fiction focused on emotional lives, not battles/politics (loves: *All the Light We Cannot See*, *The Nightingale*)

- **"Prose Savorer"**: Reader who values how something is said as much as what is said—language itself is the pleasure (loves: *Cloud Cuckoo Land*, *Lincoln in the Bardo*)

- **"Hope Archaeologist"**: Reader who digs for glimmers of light even in dark stories—needs to find meaning in suffering (loves: *A Man Called Ove*, *The Midnight Library*)

### Process for Creating Archetypes

**Step 1: Identify the core pattern**
- Review loves, hates, deal-breakers
- What's the unifying thread?
- What does this reader chase or avoid most intensely?

**Step 2: Find the metaphor**
- What image captures this pattern?
- What verb describes their approach? (Excavate, chase, wander, seek, savor...)
- What noun represents what they're after? (Wounds, storms, dragons, worlds, truth...)

**Step 3: Test for resonance**
- Does it capture something essential but not obvious?
- Would the reader think "wow, yes, that's me"?
- Is it specific enough to differentiate from other readers?
- Is it short enough to remember?

**Step 4: Write the explanation**
- One sentence that unpacks the archetype
- Include 1-2 example books/authors that epitomize it
- Ground in the reader's actual stated preferences

### Archetypes to Avoid

- "The Emotional Reader" (too vague)
- "Literary Fiction Enthusiast" (just a genre)
- "Character-Over-Plot Person" (clinical, not evocative)
- "Sophisticated Intellectual" (sounds judgmental)
- "Fantasy Escapist" (negative connotation)
- "Speed Reader" (about behavior, not preference)

## Profile Coherence Guidelines

A coherent profile tells a unified story about the reader. Patterns should make sense together.

### Recognizing Coherent Patterns

**Common coherent combinations**:

- **Literary Fiction Lover**:
  - Prose: Dense/layered (Woolf, Pynchon)
  - Pacing: Slow to moderate (Knausgård, Rooney)
  - Character: Deep psychological focus
  - Tone: Serious to bittersweet

- **Epic Fantasy Enthusiast**:
  - Worldbuilding: Rich, intricate (Tolkien, Sanderson)
  - Pacing: Slow burn with momentum
  - Character: Balanced with plot
  - Prose: Moderate density

- **Contemporary Romance Reader**:
  - Tone: Optimistic to bittersweet
  - Pacing: Moderate to brisk
  - Character: Strong focus on relationships
  - Prose: Clear, accessible

- **Psychological Thriller Fan**:
  - Pacing: Brisk to rapid
  - Character: Enough depth to create suspense
  - Tone: Dark to serious
  - Prose: Clear, propulsive

### Recognizing Complex (But Valid) Patterns

**Some combinations are less common but entirely coherent**:

- **Literary Thriller Reader**:
  - Prose: Dense (Gillian Flynn, Tana French)
  - Pacing: Brisk
  - Character: Deep psychological
  - Why it works: Complexity serves suspense

- **Humorous Satire with Depth**:
  - Tone: Light, comedic
  - Character: Surprisingly deep
  - Prose: Rich, playful
  - Why it works: Humor reveals truth (Pratchett, Vonnegut)

- **Plot-Driven Literary**:
  - Pacing: Brisk
  - Prose: Dense
  - Character: Moderate
  - Why it works: Genre-blending (Mitchell, Egan)

### Flagging Incoherent Patterns

**If you see these, probe further**:

- Dense prose + Extreme speed pacing
  - Question: "Do you like thriller pacing with complex prose, or are these separate moods?"

- Minimal character focus + Deeply psychological
  - Question: "Are you more interested in ideas/plot or character inner life?"

- Light/comedic tone + Graphic violence
  - Question: "Is this dark comedy, or do you like these separately?"

### Handling Contradictions

**Don't force coherence—some readers are genuinely contradictory**:

**Document it explicitly**:
- "Context-dependent: Loves both slow-burn literary fiction (Rooney) and fast-paced thrillers (Flynn)—mood matters"
- "Genre-specific: Wants deep character work in contemporary but pure plot in sci-fi"

**Look for the underlying pattern**:
- Maybe it's not a contradiction—maybe they want "emotional intensity" which can come from slow character work OR high-stakes plot
- The through-line might be theme, setting, or emotional impact rather than style

### Using Loves/Hates to Validate

**The profile should predict the loves and explain the hates**:

If profile says: "More Hemingway than Pynchon—values spare prose"
But loves include: *Infinite Jest* (Pynchon-level dense)
→ Flag for review: Either the profile is wrong or there's nuance missing

If profile says: "Deal-breaker: Unhappy endings"
But loves include: *A Little Life* (devastating ending)
→ Probe: "I noticed you loved A Little Life despite the tragic ending—what made that work?"

---

## Conclusion

This rubric is a guide, not a formula. Every reader is unique, and the goal is to capture that uniqueness through:
- Rich comparative statements instead of reductive numbers
- Specific, grounded reasons drawn from their own words
- Clear distinction between preferences and deal-breakers
- An evocative archetype that synthesizes their literary identity

The profile should feel like a gift—a mirror showing the reader something true about themselves they may not have articulated before.
