## Template Guidelines

1. **reader_archetype**: A memorable 2-3 word label that captures their reading identity. Should feel prescient and create a "wow" moment for the reader. Examples: "Inner Dragon Slayer", "Quiet Storm Chaser", "Wound Excavator"

2. **Loved books with reasons**: Every book they loved must have a reason explaining WHY it worked for them. Ground the reason in their actual words.

3. **Hated books with reasons**: Every book they disliked must have a reason explaining WHY it didn't work. This is crucial for recommendation filtering.

4. **Resonant moments**: Specific scenes or passages they mentioned. These are high-signal for matching similar emotional beats.

5. **Boundaries**: Clearly separate deal-breakers (will cause DNF) from strong preferences (important but flexible) from flexible items (can go either way).

6. **Comparisons**: The "In shorthand" line should include 1-2 comparative statements like "More Sally Rooney than Thomas Pynchon" to quickly calibrate recommendations.

7. **Anti-patterns**: Written FOR recommenders (LLM or human), not to the reader. Should be actionable guidance.
