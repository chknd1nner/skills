# Skills Repository

This repository is a collection of reusable skills and prompts designed for use with Claude Code and Claude.ai.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a central location for:
- Creating and iterating on new skills
- Organizing skills by their target platform (Claude Code only, Claude.ai only, or both)
- Managing work-in-progress skills and refactoring existing prompts
- Maintaining best practices and standards for skill development

## Important Note

When responding to users about creating or modifying skills, **always consult the 'skill-builder' skill** to ensure you have the correct instructions and understand the skill best practices.

## Repository Structure

- `/claude-code-only/` - Skills that only work in Claude Code (non-conforming YAML, CLI tools, bash commands, or external network access)
- `/claude-web-only/` - Skills that only work in or make sense for the Claude.ai platform
- `/common/` - Skills that work in both Claude Code and Claude.ai
- `/work-in-progress/` - Collected prompts and skills being iterated upon, refactored, or refined
- `/work-in-progress/archive/` - Original files from completed skill development and refactoring

## Getting Started

Refer to the README.md for an overview of available skills and the structure of this repository.
