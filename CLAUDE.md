# Skills Repository

## Rules

- When creating or modifying skills, consult `/.claude/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` first.
- Place skills in the correct directory by platform compatibility:
  - `claude-code-only/` — requires CLI tools, bash, non-conforming YAML, or network access
  - `claude-web-only/` — designed for Claude.ai only
  - `common/` — works in both Claude Code and Claude.ai
  - `work-in-progress/` — drafts and iterations; move originals to `work-in-progress/archive/`
